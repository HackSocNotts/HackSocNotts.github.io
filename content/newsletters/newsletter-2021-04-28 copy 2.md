### Lighting Talks!

Coming up on the 4th of May at 7pm on [Zoom](https://hacksoc.net/zoom), we have a series of lightning talk given by our members.

For those unfamiliar, a lighting talk is a short (three to five minute) talk giving a quick dive into a specific topic. This should be a fun night with people enthusing about their interests, so be sure to come along.

Got a topic you want to share? If you want to give a talk yourself open a ticket on the discord server, or drop us an email to [events@hacksocnotts.co.uk](mailto:events@hacksocnotts.co.uk)
