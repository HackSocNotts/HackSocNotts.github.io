## About this Workshop
During this workshop, you’ll learn the structure and syntax of basic HTML and CSS. You will receive a skeleton of a portfolio website and will update the HTML to include information about yourself and edit the CSS to style and position elements on the page! Then, they’ll deploy your new website.

## HTML & CSS
HTML is the skeleton of every website on the internet and nearly all websites use CSS for styling. Learning HTML and CSS is the first step toward building a personal website, becoming more technically fluent, or beginning a career in web development or design!

## Deployment
While learning to edit HTML elements and CSS properties is an important first step toward making a website, there are more steps to getting a website publicly available on the internet. In this workshop, participants will use a simple deployment tool to get their website live before they leave!
