Mark Goodwin

We all depend on HTTPS for security on the web but a key component of this has been broken for as long as we've been using it. Listen to a Nottingham-based browser engineer talk about this problem, how people have tried (and failed) to fix it in the past and what Mozilla are doing to fix it now.

###About Mark

Mark is a software security specialist with decades of experience in building, breaking and securing Internet facing systems. Mark currently works for  Mozilla on the Firefox web browser.

Cara Holland

An exploration of why we should all be working more visually (even if you can’t draw at all).

With a focus on drawing in UX, this talk is for everyone who has to explain, engage, explore or problem solve in their work. 

This is a hands on session…there will be drawing!

### About Cara

The Graphic Change Academy has trained people to work more visually in over 59 countries (and counting) and her book Draw a Better Business was published in September 2018.
