__Kotlin from Start to Somewhere__

In this workshop, run by our Dev Secretary Daniel Cordell, you'll gain a basic understanding of the Kotlin programming language in a small crash course.

Kotlin is a really interesting programming language, very similar to Java in some respects but a much more friendly syntax. Kotlin can be used for **web programming** and **mobile development**.

Programming knowledge is not necessarily required, but may be useful to pick up some new concepts. Don't worry if you have no programming experience, our team of mentors will be there to assist!
