Join us at the Rose & Crown for Slideshow Karaoke. If you've not played before, don't fret; the TLDR is that someone will get up and present (and answer questions on) a completely random set of slides that they don't have control over.

## Drinks
We'll be providing drinks vouchers during the event and if you don't eat before, the Rose & Crown have a wide variety of food on their menu.

## What is Slideshow Karaoke - [MLH](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/slideshow-karaoke/)
Slideshow Karaoke is a fun game where participants are called up to the stage one at a time. The audience will shout out topics and organizer will use those topic suggestions to find a random yet topical slide deck on the Internet. The participant on stage will then present the slide deck without getting to view the content. The organizer will keep time and progress the slidedeck as the participant makes their presentation.
