**The Bad Code-Athon Challenge!**

Do you ever find that the code you're writing is too readable or too well documented? Have you ever wondered what would happen if you let your inhibitions go and wrote code straight from the heart?Â 

Come along to our Bad Code-Athon Challenge and compete with your peers to write the worst code possible!

In this event, the code must be functional (not necessarily that kind of functional), but that's about it. The harder to understand, the better! So brush up on your pointer arithmetic, polish up those integer overflows and bring back those nested ternaries because it's time for HackSoc's Bad Code-Athon Challenge!
