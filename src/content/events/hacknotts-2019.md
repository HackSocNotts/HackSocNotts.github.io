## What's a hackathon?

A [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) is a collaborative programming festival. The main goal is to try to create a project in a relatively short amount of time, such as 24 hours. It's a fantastic opportunity to meet new people, learn from mentors, and make cool stuff.

## What's HackNotts?

[HackNotts](https://hacknotts.com) is our annual hackathon, hosted in the School of Computer Science on Jubilee Campus. This year, the event will be running over the weekend of the 16th and 17th of November, with the opening presentations starting some time around 11am on the Saturday, and the closing presentation will be early in the evening on the Sunday.

## Who can attend?

You're allowed to attend HackNotts if you are:

- At least 18 years old,
- A highschool, undergraduate or postgraduate student, or
- A graduate who is less than a year out of university

## Do I need to have a team?

Not at all! You can of course come to the event with a team already planned, but there are loads of people who don't have teams when they arrive. At the start of the event, we'll help to make sure that everybody has a team, if they want one.

## Where can I find out more?

You can check out the [HackNotts website](https://hacknotts.com) to find the links for tickets, a more extensive FAQ, and the event's sponsors.
