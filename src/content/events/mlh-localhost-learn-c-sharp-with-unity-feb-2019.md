##About this Workshop
In this workshop, you will interact with a 3D car racing game written in C# and developed using the Unity Game Engine. You will learn how to set up the Unity Engine on their computers, explore the project files, fix broken functions in the game, and publish their games for others to play!

##Scripting in C
C# is one of the most popular languages for game development. Guide participants through a basic introduction to syntax and structure in C# and watch them fix a broken game!

##The Unity Engine
Unity is the all-in-one creation tool for real time development. With Unity, you can rapidly iterate on your 2D and 3D development and publish your games and AR/VR projects to over 25 platforms. With support from the community of Unity users, you can easy grab assets, plugins, or extensions to use as you develop your projects from the Asset Store. Through this workshop, you will be able to see how easy and quick it is to bring your project to reality with Unity.
