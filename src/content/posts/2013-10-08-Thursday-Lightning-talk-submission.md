Hi there,
If you want to give a lightning talk at the Thursday session, please send your title and description to this email address by 2pm on Thursday. If you're submitting a talk for a future date, please have it in by 2pm on that date, and if sending it more than a week in advance, please date it with which session you'd like to speak at.

Speakers must be at the venue for the tutorial by 8pm.

Cheers,

Joe
