Apologies for the 3rd email in a day, I had incorrectly assumed everyone had seen the schedule, and so have gotten a lot of emails about the time.
The tutorials will run 6pm-11pm. If you want to hack/program and follow along with the tutorial, you will have to bring a laptop or other device capable of programming.

The schedule is here:
