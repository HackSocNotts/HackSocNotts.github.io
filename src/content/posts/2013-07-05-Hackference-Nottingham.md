Hello everyone!
Hope you're enjoying your summer so far, and that this email can make it a little more awesome!
There is a 3 day hackathon event taking place in Nottingham on the 2nd to the 4th of August. Day one is a day of talks followed by two days of hacking. It looks like it's going to be a great event and it's great that one is being hosted in Nottingham for once. We've reserved 10 tickets at the slightly discounted price of Â£25 each.

If you are interested in purchasing one of these tickets, reply to this email or grab any exec member on facebook as soon as possible to ensure you get a place!

Cheers!
Joe
