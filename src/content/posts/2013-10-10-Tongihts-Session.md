Hello everyone!
Just a quick note about tonights session, and the sessions going forward.
This session will start at 6pm, in the Hub, Computer Science building, Jubilee Campus, but is likely to be quite short; it will mainly be an intro to the format of these socials, what to expect etc. There will be a Python tutorial for complete beginners to programming; this is likely to be quite dry if you can already program. Experienced programmers should come along anyway, as we also want these sessions to act as a mixing pot for skills and ideas and to get some cool projects coming out of them! We have a few example projects ready as well so you're welcome to contribute to them.

It's been pointed out that 6pm-11pm is both quite long, and doesn't give much time between last lecture and the start of the session for food etc. To that end, from now on, the Thursday tutorial sessions will run from 8pm-11pm.

Cheers,

Joe
