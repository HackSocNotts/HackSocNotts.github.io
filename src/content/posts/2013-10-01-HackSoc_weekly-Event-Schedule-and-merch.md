Hello everyone!
Firstly, thanks for joining HackSoc and expressing your interest in what we do. We've had a great uptake of members this year, and HackDay has sold out, so we're over the moon.
Secondly, congratulations to our Hackathon team at OverTheAir this past weekend, with Paula Besson and Ryan Shaw walking away with the prize for Best Hardware Hack, and Craig Knott and George Hallam walking away with Audience Favourite. Great result!
And merchandise is now available for sale! Once we get to 25 orders we'll place the order and it'll be here within 2 weeks.
The schedule for our weekly events is now available at:
