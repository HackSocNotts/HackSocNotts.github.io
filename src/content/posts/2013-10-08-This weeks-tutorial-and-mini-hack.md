Hello everyone!

This weeks tutorial is on Programming for Beginners, with Python. It will be held in the Computer Science building on Jubilee Campus, in the Hub.

It's not too late to submit a lightning talk if you haven't already!
For those of you who want to come along and hack but not do the tutorial, we will have space and refreshments available, and a couple of suggested projects.

The equipment rental desk will also be open, if you want to play with the Arduino kits, Raspberry pis, Makey Makeys or the AR Drone 2.0 Quadcopter.

Cheers,

Joe
