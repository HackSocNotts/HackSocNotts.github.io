Vikram Chhapwale, one of our very own members, will be doing a talk on his experience with product design during his time on placement in the tech industry.

After we'll be facilitating an environment for members to mingle and discuss what they learned. For anyone interested in product design, or design in general, it's an amazing opportunity to meet and discuss with like-minded and creative people!

As always we'll be providing snacks and soft drinks.
