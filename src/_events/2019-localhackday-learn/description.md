__What is Local Hack Day: Learn?__

Local Hack Day: Learn is a global day-long conference. You can pick up the new skills you need by participating in workshops and talks with a community around the world. Over the course of 12 hours, attendees will experience a series of workshops where theyâ€™ll learn skills such as publishing their first website using AWS, sending their first SMS with Twilio, and building their first game in Unity.

This is an event for all skill levels, from beginners to the most veteran developers. Workshop attendees will learn skills that they can apply in their projects, schoolwork, job, and beyond.
