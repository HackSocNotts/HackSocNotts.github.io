## About this Workshop
During this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of building apps for the Slack ecosystem!

## Build a Slack App
Slack is a tool that helps teams at work collaborate more effectively. Slack offers APIs that enable developers to build apps that extend Slack’s functionality, like integrating with other software or building custom workflows for your team. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to build a Slack app that uses interactive features like buttons, menus, and actions to help your team get work done and be able to install it on your own workspace.

## What will you build?
In this workshop, participants will build a Two Truths and a Lie app for their Slack organization using Node.js, Glitch, and the Slack API!
