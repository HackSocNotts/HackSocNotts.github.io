# It may feel like our first event was just yesterday, but it's come time for us to elect a new committee take HackSoc forward.

It's been an excellent year for HackSoc! We've run five times the number of events as last year! Including HackNotts, MLH Local Hack Day, Workshops using a half-dozen different languages, brought in six external speakers and had record attendance numbers for some events.

Like all societies, it's time for us to elect a new committee. Some of us will be running again, and others will be moving on. If you'd like to nominate yourself details are below.


## When / Where

The AGM will be held in the Hub from 18:30 to 20:30 on April 1st. Pizza and Drinks will be provided. Membership will be verified before you're given access to an eBallot.

**We strongly urge you to bring a laptop, as our voting platform sometimes has issues on mobile devices.**

## Will the be pizza?
