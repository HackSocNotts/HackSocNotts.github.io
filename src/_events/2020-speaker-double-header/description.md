***Building and Breaking*** with **Mark Goodwin**

Mark is a security engineer at Mozilla with some 20 years of experience building secure software. Mark will be giving us a look at how the science of building secure software and the art of breaking software security differ (and how they're the same). From a software engineer who breaks things (or, a security engineer who makes things).

***Introduction to Alexa.Net*** with **Steve Pears**

Steve is a software engineer at Experian and co-author of Alexa.Net. 

Alexa.NET is a helper library for working with Alexa skill requests/responses in C#. Whether you are using the AWS Lambda service or hosting your own service on your server, this library aims just to make working with the Alexa API more natural for a C# developer using a strongly-typed object model.

 In this talk Steven starts with a dice roller Alexa Skill written in .NET and will demonstrate how we can enhance it to offer much more than just speech.
