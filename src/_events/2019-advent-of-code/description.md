[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in *any* programming language you like. People use them for interview prep, company training,  practice problems, or to challenge each other. It's also a good way to learn new programming languages, or boost your skills as a programmer!

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
