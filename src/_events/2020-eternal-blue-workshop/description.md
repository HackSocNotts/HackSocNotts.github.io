The second workshop of the year will focus on demonstrating some of the skills and techniques of ethical hacking that were mentioned in the introduction to cyber security. During the session you will watch a live demonstration from our guest speaker Tash who will show the steps required to gain root access on a windows server with the eternal blue vulnerability. This will help you become familiar with the techniques required to replicate the attack yourself the following week.
