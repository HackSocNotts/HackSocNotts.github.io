The third workshop of the year will focus on applying the skills that have been shown to you in the previous session the week before. This interactive workshop will give you the opportunity to take the steps required to gain control over a windows server with the eternal blue vulnerability. If you didn't attend the previous session, not to worry each part of the process will be carefully explained so that the workshop is accessible regardless of your level of experience.
