# As we approach the end of term it becomes time to elect the next HackSoc Committee. 

It's been an excellent year for HackSoc! We've been running regular hardware and cyber security events in addition to our typical workshop content. We've gotten back into hacakthons, and have seen an overall member and engagement bump over past years.

Like all societies, it's time for us to elect a new committee. Some of us will be running again, but most of us will be moving on. If you'd like to nominate yourself details are below.


## When / Where

The AGM will be held in the The Exchange, LT3 from 19:00 to 21:30 on March 24th‚Äìwe hope to end earlier than that. Pizza and Drinks will be provided. Membership will be verified upon entry.

## Will the be pizza?
**YES!!!** üçïüçïüçïüçï

If you have any dietary requirements, such as being vegan, gluten free, or lactose intolerant, and plan to attend, pleas let us know my March 22nd.

## Join Committee

Being a member of the committee is a great way to build your CV, get experience working with companies and bureaucratic structures (the Student's Union) as well as event organizing.

Additionally, if you'd like to see the HackSoc [constitution](https://hacksoc.net/constitution) change, you can submit amendments at [hacksoc.net/amend](https://hacksoc.net/amend).
