### About the Deep Learning Workshops

Welcome all, to a new workshop on deep learning - specifically using Convolutional Neural Networks to answer questions about the content of images. 

We will be separating out cats and dogs, classifying handwritten digits and there will be a special extension task for the more ambitious amongst youâ€¦

Whether you are a beginner or a budding expert, this event will have something for you to get stuck into. All we ask you to bring is a laptop, and your own enthusiasm.

### About Alex & Olli

Alex & Olli work for OpenWrks and Instrumental - different companies within the Blenheim Chalcot portfolio. 

Alex is OpenWrks' Chief Analytics Officer, managing a team of 5 data scientists, who have built and continue to develop a machine learning categorisation engine which translates complex banking transaction data into user friendly labelled output. An MMath qualified mathematician (Loughborough), he is proud of the data driven decisioning culture created at OpenWrks across all business product development.

Olli is a Data Scientist at Instrumental using AI to scout for new music artists. Born and raised in Nottingham, he graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2018 with a BSc in Mathematics and is currently pursuing an MSc alongside his work. He is passionate about deep learning from both a practical perspective - what it can be used for, how it can create new things - but also what deep learning really means at a pure mathematical level; and is doubly passionate about helping new people learn about it to help fertilise the field with new ideas!
