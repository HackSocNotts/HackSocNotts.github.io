Been meaning to make something or learn something, or get into a new habit?  This session is about turning those wishes into practical plans.

Part talk, part actual planning experiment, with a few minutes of small-group discussion scattered through.

Bring a wish, idea or ambition (or a few of them!) and we’ll turn them into a plan!

## How Very Ladylike: Femininity And Service Design

“My name is Sophie. I’m a woman, I work in tech. I'm also a Service Designer … which is surprisingly harder to explain than you might think!I find myself immersed in a working world of complex problems that need creative thinking to establish logical solutions. 

There is a natural tendency to view a problem like a wild beast, with the main aim being to tame it as soon as possible.  For me, the route to order starts with chaos – and by that I don’t mean weaponised “post-its and power point”.

You see, there’s a certain ‘lady-ness’ that I know I employ in my day-to-day. It helps me get stuff done. But what is it?

So… I started thinking about what ‘feminine’ means and how it fits in my working context. I went back through time, looked at the stories we tell ourselves and the myths we create, and discovered that service design is one of the most feminine activities going!

This isn’t a battle of the sexes, it’s navigating through problems by finding comfort in chaos.”

### About Sophie
Sophie is a multi-award winning Service Designer, skilled at creating and delivering engaging and effective omni-channel experiences across public and private sectors. 

She is known for taking a holistic but pragmatic approach to design challenges, inspiring multi-disciplinary teams to rally around the needs of customer and swears by the mantra of the “elegance of simplicity” … she also writes remarkably neatly on post-it’s for a left-hander.
