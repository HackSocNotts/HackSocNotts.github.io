Come along to our first Programming Meet-Up! 

Show off or work on personal projects, or complete that tricky bit of coursework. Regardless of what you want to do, we want to provide an environment for collaboration and sharing of ideas. Committee will be showing off things that they're working on, so feel free to bring something along to demo as well!

Snacks and Drinks will be provided.
