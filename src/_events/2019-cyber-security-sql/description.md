These workshops are designed to raise awareness toward web application security and teach students how to detect, prevent and respond to the latest cyber security challenges. All the workshops are based on OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) top 10.

## SQL Injection

A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or injection of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. In this workshop the students will learn how to detect SQL injection using different tools and techniques and how to avoid these vulnerabilities.

 
All the workshops provided with a copy of [OWASP Broken Web Applications Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project) to practice and learn more about web application security.
