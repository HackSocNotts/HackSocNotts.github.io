## Jurassic Park: What Went Wrong?
_by [Andrew Seward](https://twitter.com/MrAndrew)_

"Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?"

In this talk, 65 million years in the making, Andrew Seward (@MrAndrew) and the audience will use Root Cause Analysis to follow a logical approach to figuring out what went wrong at Jurassic Park and propose some actions that can ensure the safe deployment of dinosaur parks in the future.

A lot of ideas are banded about in the 1993 film that suggest why things went awry, but that’s not unusual when a there’s a live issue. Following a methodical approach will show why these reactionary ideas are flawed, what actually caused the issues and we will hopefully learn some valuable lessons about how to deal with live incidents in our own systems in the future.
