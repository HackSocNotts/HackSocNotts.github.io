## About this Workshop
During this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of blockchain technology, what this means for the future of the internet, what makes Quorum different, and how to interact with your own decentralized application built on the Quorum network.

## Quorum
Quorum is an open source fork of the Ethereum blockchain based on the Go Ethereum implementation, developed by J.P. Morgan. Quorum is ideal for any application requiring high speed and high throughput processing of private transactions within a permissioned group of known participants. Quorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry and beyond.

## TechMarketplace Decentralized App
By interacting with the codebase of a fully-functional decentralized application, you will learn the structure of a dApp and how to write functions in Solidity, the Contract-Oriented language. They will leave the workshop understanding how all of these pieces fit together.
