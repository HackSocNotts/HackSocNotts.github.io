The HackSoc EGM is happening soon! It's a chance for you to get involved in the future of the society or potentially joining the committee to have a hand in the governance of the society on the path going forward. (You also get to make new friends and it looks great on a CV!). It's important that we get a large turnout, so we need as many people there as possible. 

A link to the agenda can be found here: https://hacksoc.net/egm-agenda But the most important thing is we need applicants to the role of Sponsor Secretary. In that role you'll be responsible for liaising with companies to provide sponsorship of workshops and events run by HackSoc.
